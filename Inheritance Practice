# You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:
A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
- A string, firstName
- A string, lastName
- An integer, id
An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores

A char calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
A | 90-100
B | 80-89
C | 70-79
D | 60-69
F | <60

# Step one create the two classes
class Person:
    def __init__(self,fname,lname):
        self.fname = fname
        self.lname = lname
        
# The only indentifiers Person are first and last name. Students have them and one more: student id.
        
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, fname, lname, student_id):
        self.id = int(student_id)
        Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)
        
# Next part we need is gpa. But don't have that, we need to calculate it.
        
    def calculate(self,list):
        points = 0
        total = len(list)
        
        for num in list:
            points = points + num
            
        gpa = points/total
        
        if gpa >= 90 and gpa <= 100:
            print(self.fname + " " + self.lname + " " + "Student ID " + str(self.id) + ", you have an A.")
        elif gpa >= 80 and gpa <= 89:
            print(self.fname + " " + self.lname + " " + "Student ID " + str(self.id) + ", you have a B.")
        elif gpa >= 70 and gpa <= 79:
            print(self.fname + " " + self.lname + " " + "Student ID " + str(self.id) + ", you have a C.")
        elif gpa >= 60 and gpa <= 69:
            print(self.fname + " " + self.lname + " " + "Student ID " + str(self.id) + ", you have a D.")
        elif gpa < 60:
            print(self.fname + " " + self.lname + " " + "Student ID " + str(self.id) + ", you have an F.")
            
# Make a person that is also a student.
person1 = Student(str(input("First name: ")),str(input("Last name: ")), int(input("Student ID: ")))
grades = input("Enter a list grades separated by space: ")
grades = list(map(int, grades.split()))
